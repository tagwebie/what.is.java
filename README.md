Java is a general-purpose, class-based, object-oriented programming language designed for having lesser implementation dependencies. It is a computing platform for application development. Java is fast, secure, and reliable, therefore. It is widely used for developing Java applications in laptops, data centers, game consoles, scientific supercomputers, cell phones, etc.


## What is Java Programming?

Java is a write-once, run-anywhere programming language developed by Sun Microsystems. It is similar to C and C++ but a lot easier. You can combine Java with a lot of technologies like Spring, node js, Android, Hadoop, J2EE, etc… to build robust, scalable, portable and distributed full-fledged applications. Java also promotes continuous integration and testing using tools like Selenium.

## History of Java

Java was originally developed by James Gosling with his colleagues at Sun Microsystems during the early 1990s. Initially, it was called a project ‘Oak’ which had implementation similar to C and C++. The name Java has later selected after enough brainstorming and is based on the name of an espresso bean. Java 1.0, the first version was released in 1995 with the tagline of ‘write once, run anywhere’. Later, Sun Microsystems was acquired by Oracle. From there, there has been no looking back. The latest version of Java is Java 12 released in March 2019.

## Features of Java

**Java offers plenty of attractive features -**

* Platform independent language
* Rich standard library making it easy to code. You can create a whole stand-alone application using Java.
* Java supports automatic memory allocation and deallocation (called garbage collection).
* It offers great performance as Java supports multithreading and concurrency, thus making it a highly interactive and responsive language.
* Secure and simple
